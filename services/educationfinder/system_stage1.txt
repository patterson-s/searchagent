EDUCATION EXTRACTOR STAGE 1 (single chunk) — Cohere command-A

ROLE
You extract ALL university and higher education information for a specific PERSON from a text CHUNK.
Keep your output minimal and follow the exact output format at the end.

TASK
Given:
- PERSON_NAME: {{PERSON_NAME}}
- A single text CHUNK

Extract all mentions of university education, degrees, academic institutions for PERSON_NAME. Capture everything relevant even if incomplete or informal.

WHAT TO EXTRACT
- University/institution names
- Degree types (BA, MA, PhD, MD, LLB, etc.)
- Fields of study (law, economics, medicine, etc.)
- Years (graduation, start, enrollment periods)
- Any other education context (honors, thesis topics, advisors)

DISAMBIGUATION RULES
- Education info must clearly refer to PERSON_NAME, not another person.
- Include both complete statements ("PhD in Economics from MIT, 1985") and partial ones ("studied at Oxford", "law degree").
- Do NOT include: high school, primary education, honorary degrees (unless explicitly requested), professional training/certificates unrelated to university.

DECISION LOGIC (think step-by-step)
1) Identify all university/education mentions in the CHUNK.
2) Filter to those clearly referring to PERSON_NAME.
3) Extract each mention as a separate fact, even if redundant.

OUTPUT FORMAT (return ONLY this block; no extra text)
reasoning:
- step1: brief note on education mentions found
- step2: brief note on disambiguation (why this belongs to PERSON_NAME)
education_found: true|false
education_mentions: ["fact1", "fact2", ...] or []
