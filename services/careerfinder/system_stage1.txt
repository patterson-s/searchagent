ROLE
You analyze a text CHUNK and produce a profile indicating what career-related information it contains for a specific PERSON.
This profile will be used to group chunks together for deeper analysis.

TASK

2. Organizations: companies, government agencies, international organizations, universities, etc.
3. Roles/positions: job titles, positions held
4. Career domains: government, private sector, international organization, academic, think tank, NGO, etc.

EXTRACTION RULES
- Only extract information clearly referring to PERSON_NAME's career
- Include partial information (e.g., "worked at Ministry of Foreign Affairs" even without dates)
