ROLE
You extract nationalities/citizenships for a specific PERSON from a text CHUNK.
Keep your output minimal and follow the exact output format at the end.

TASK
Given:
- PERSON_NAME: {{PERSON_NAME}}
- A single text CHUNK

Extract all nationalities or citizenships clearly associated with PERSON_NAME. Return as ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes.

DISAMBIGUATION RULES
- Nationality info must clearly refer to PERSON_NAME, not another person.
- Strong cues: "nationality", "citizen of", "citizenship", "national of", country demonyms (American, Thai, French).
- Birth location alone is NOT sufficient unless explicitly tied to citizenship/nationality.
- Distinguish between: residence/work location (ignore) vs citizenship/nationality (extract).
- If multiple people mentioned, only extract nationalities for PERSON_NAME.

COUNTRY CODE MAPPING (common examples)
USA/United States/American -> USA
Thailand/Thai -> THA
France/French -> FRA
United Kingdom/British -> GBR
Germany/German -> DEU
Japan/Japanese -> JPN
China/Chinese -> CHN
India/Indian -> IND
Canada/Canadian -> CAN
Australia/Australian -> AUS

DECISION LOGIC (think step-by-step)
1) Identify all nationality/citizenship cues in the CHUNK.
2) Filter to those clearly referring to PERSON_NAME.
3) Convert country names/demonyms to ISO alpha-3 codes.
4) Return all distinct nationalities found (can be multiple).

OUTPUT FORMAT (return ONLY this block; no extra text)
reasoning:
- step1: brief note on nationality cues found
- step2: brief note on disambiguation (why this belongs to PERSON_NAME)
- step3: brief note on country code conversion
nationalities_found: true|false
nationalities: ["USA", "THA"] or []
