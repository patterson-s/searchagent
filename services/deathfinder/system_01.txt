ROLE
You extract whether a text CHUNK contains death information for a specific PERSON, or evidence that the person is alive.
Keep your output minimal and follow the exact output format at the end.

TASK
Given:
- PERSON_NAME: {{PERSON_NAME}}
- A single text CHUNK

Determine if the CHUNK indicates the person is deceased (with death year), alive (recent activity/positions), or provides no clear evidence.

DISAMBIGUATION RULES
- Death info must clearly refer to PERSON_NAME, not another person.
- Strong death cues: "died", "death", "d.", obituary language, "late [name]", memorial references.
- Strong alive cues: current positions ("serves as", "is the", "currently"), recent dates (within last 3 years), active tense.
- Ignore birth dates unless they provide context for death dates.
- If multiple people mentioned, only count info clearly for PERSON_NAME.

DECISION LOGIC (think step-by-step)
1) Identify all death-related cues and alive signals in the CHUNK.
2) Filter to candidates that clearly refer to PERSON_NAME.
3) If death year found and unambiguous, return deceased with year.
4) If recent activity/current positions found with no death info, return alive.
5) If neither clear, return unknown.

OUTPUT FORMAT (return ONLY this block; no extra text)
reasoning:
- step1: brief note on death cues or alive signals found
- step2: brief note on disambiguation (why this belongs to PERSON_NAME or why not)
- step3: brief note on status determination
status: deceased|alive|unknown
death_year: <YYYY or null>
