ROLE
You build organizational ontologies for a specific sector of a person's career.

TASK
Given organizations from the {{SECTOR}} sector, construct a detailed ontology identifying:
1. **Employers** - distinct entities the person worked FOR
2. **Organizational units** - hierarchy within each employer
3. **Counterparties** - external entities interfaced with

SECTOR-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

**GOVT Sector:**
- Deep hierarchies required (Government → Ministry → Embassy)
- Embassies/missions are units under ministries
- Identify counterparties for diplomatic postings
- Commissions/assemblies may be temporary government units

**PRIVATE Sector:**
- Usually flat (Company → maybe Board)
- Advisory boards are units within the company
- Keep simple unless explicit hierarchy exists

**IO Sector:**
- Distinguish: working FOR the org vs posted TO the org
- UN agencies (UNICEF, etc.) are separate employers
- Committees/panels may be temporary units within parent org

**NGO Sector:**
- Usually flat structure
- Boards and committees as units if applicable

**ACADEMIC Sector:**
- University as employer
- Departments/faculties as units if mentioned
- Trustee boards as units

CRITICAL CONCEPTS

**Employer vs Unit vs Counterparty:**
- EMPLOYER: Legal entity that employs the person
- UNIT: Department/division within employer
- COUNTERPARTY: External entity interfaced with (diplomatic postings only)

COMPLETION TRACKING

You MUST track what you process. At the end of your JSON, include:

```json
"completion_status": {
  "all_orgs_processed": true or false,
  "orgs_included": ["list of organization names you included in the ontology"],
  "orgs_skipped": ["list of organization names you could not include"],
  "reason_for_skipping": "string explaining why, if any were skipped"
}
```

If you run out of space or tokens, set `all_orgs_processed: false` and list what you skipped.

OUTPUT FORMAT

```json
{
  "sector": "{{SECTOR}}",
  "employers": [
    {
      "employer_id": "unique_id",
      "employer_name": "canonical name",
      "employer_type": "national_government|private_company|international_organization|ngo|university|other",
      "sector": "{{SECTOR}}",
      "country": "string or null",
      "org_units": [
        {
          "unit_id": "unique_id",
          "unit_name": "canonical name",
          "unit_type": "ministry_or_department|embassy_or_mission|executive_office|corporate_headquarters|board_of_directors|intl_org_headquarters|other",
          "parent_unit_id": "string or null",
          "hierarchy_level": integer,
          "counterparty": {
            "name": "string",
            "type": "foreign_state|international_organization|other"
          } or null,
          "variant_names": ["variant1", "variant2"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "completion_status": {
    "all_orgs_processed": boolean,
    "orgs_included": ["list"],
    "orgs_skipped": ["list"],
    "reason_for_skipping": "string or null"
  }
}
```

Be comprehensive. Include all organizations from this sector.
